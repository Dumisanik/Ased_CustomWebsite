Definition: A Non-Profit-Organisation uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, 
rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders.

By sharing tangible skills, leadership skills, business ideas, market research or similar
we can develop endless economical activities that are aim for the sole purpose of improving
